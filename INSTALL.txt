This brief document will guide you through the installation process of ccnSim-v0.4.


Requirements
------------

- Omnet++ (>= 4.1)
It can be downloaded from "http://www.omnetpp.org", and installed following its 
installation instructions. 

- Boost Libraries
They can be installed either using the standard packet manager of your distribution
(e.g., apt-get install, yum install, port install, etc.), or downloading them from 
"http://www.boost.org/" and following instructions therein.


Installation
------------

In order to install ccnSim-v4.0, it is necessary to patch Omnet++ before. 
ccnSim-v4.0 comes with two different set of patches, each correspondent to
the installed version on Omnet++. 

Please follow the instructions below, which suppose the Omnet++ has been correctly
installed under the $OMNET_DIR, and that ccnSim-v4.0 has been correctly copied and 
decompressed in the $CCNSIM_DIR folder.

Issue to following command from a terminal according to the installed version of Omnet++:

- Omnetpp - v4.x

     cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     cp ./patch/omnet-4x/ctopology.h $OMNET_DIR/include/
     cp ./patch/omnet-4x/ctopology.cc $OMNET_DIR/src/sim
     cd $OMNET_DIR && make && cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     ./scripts/makemake.sh
     make

- Omnetpp - v5.x

     cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     cp ./patch/omnet-5x/ctopology.h $OMNET_DIR/include/omnetpp
     cp ./patch/omnet-5x/ctopology.cc $OMNET_DIR/src/sim
     cd $OMNET_DIR && make && cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     ./scripts/makemake.sh
     make

PLEASE read files "CHANGELOG.txt" and "README.txt" for information about
what's new inside ccnSim-v.0.4, how to correctly lunch simulations, and how to collect results.  

Although less common w.r.t. its classical use (i.e., simulations launched form the command line),
ccnSim simulations can also be executed directly from the Omnetpp environment. To do so, 
Omnetpp need to be instructed to load ccnSim .ned files (it can be done by configuring the NEDPATH environment variable).
Finally, ccnSim executable (soft-linked in $CCNSIM_DIR) must be added to your path
(e.g.,  by adding $CCNSIM_DIR to your PATH environment variable): 

     export NEDPATH=$CCNSIM_DIR:.
     export PATH=$PATH:$CCNSIM_DIR
     
You should then be able to run ccnSim simulations from omnetpp environment.
