This brief document will guide you through the installation process of ccnSim-v0.4.


Requirements
------------

- Omnetpp (>= 4.1)
It can be downloaded from "http://www.omnetpp.org", and installed following related instructions. 

- Boost Libraries
They can be installed either by using the standard packet manager of your system (e.g., apt-get install, yum install, port install, etc.), 
or by downloading them from "http://www.boost.org/", and following instructions therein.


Installation
------------

In order to install ccnSim-v0.4, it is necessary to patch Omnetpp before. 
ccnSim-v4.0 comes with two different set of patches, each correspondent to the installed version of Omnetpp (e.g., v4.x or v5.x). 

Please follow the instructions below, provided that Omnetpp is correctly installed under the $OMNET_DIR, and that the .tgz file of 
ccnSim-v0.4 has been correctly downloaded and decompressed in the $CCNSIM_DIR folder.

According to Omnetpp version, the respective ccnSim installation commands are:

- Omnetpp - v4.x

     cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     cp ./patch/omnet-4x/ctopology.h $OMNET_DIR/include/
     cp ./patch/omnet-4x/ctopology.cc $OMNET_DIR/src/sim
     cd $OMNET_DIR && make && cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     ./scripts/makemake.sh
     make

- Omnetpp - v5.x

     cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     cp ./patch/omnet-5x/ctopology.h $OMNET_DIR/include/omnetpp
     cp ./patch/omnet-5x/ctopology.cc $OMNET_DIR/src/sim
     cd $OMNET_DIR && make && cd $CCNSIM_DIR
     ./scripts/makemake.sh
     make


Additional Info
---------------

PLEASE read "CHANGELOG.txt" and "README.txt" files for information on ccnSim-v0.4 new features, 
simulation execution, and results collection.  

Although being less common w.r.t. its classical use (i.e., simulations launched form the command line), ccnSim simulations can also 
be executed directly from the Omnetpp environment. To do so, Omnetpp need to be instructed to load ccnSim .ned files (it can be done 
by configuring the NEDPATH environment variable). Finally, ccnSim executable (soft-linked in $CCNSIM_DIR) must be added to your path (e.g., by adding $CCNSIM_DIR to your PATH environment variable): 

     export NEDPATH=$CCNSIM_DIR:.
     export PATH=$PATH:$CCNSIM_DIR
     
You should then be able to run ccnSim simulations from Omnetpp environment.
